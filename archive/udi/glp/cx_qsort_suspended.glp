% Minimal test case for qsort suspension bug
% Goal 10038 suspends: reduce(qsort(X132?,X129,[1 | X135?]), X154)
%
% From trace:
% - X132 is a reader (unbound at this point)
% - X129 is writer to be bound
% - [1 | X135?] is the accumulator with X135 as reader
%
% Simplified to just the qsort clause that should match

% The failing reduction
reduce(qsort(X132?,X129,[1|X135?]), true).

% Test query
test1 :- reduce(qsort(X?,Y,[1|Z?]), R).
