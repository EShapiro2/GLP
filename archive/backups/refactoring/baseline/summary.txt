=== PHASE 0 BASELINE COMPLETE ===
Date: 2025-11-09 01:15:00 +0200
Commit: 20fd92ce

TEST COVERAGE:
- Total tests: 195
- Passing: 180 (92.3%)
- Failing: 15 (7.7%)
- Core functionality: ✅ Working

PERFORMANCE BASELINE:
- Variable lookup: O(n) - writerIdForReader scans all writers
- Register access: O(log n) - Map-based
- Suspension: Set<int> operations
- No dereferencing optimization

ID ALLOCATION PATTERN:
- Writer ID: N
- Reader ID: N+1 (confirmed consistent)
- Pattern: Reader = Writer + 1 ✅

BEHAVIORAL FINDINGS:
- Suspension: Accumulates Set<int> si and U
- ROQ: Map<int, Set<int>> (1-to-many)
- Instructions: 2x redundancy (Writer/Reader variants)
- Dereferencing: No path compression

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. O(n) variable lookup
2. Separate Writer/Reader IDs (unnecessary)
3. Set-based suspension (could be simpler)
4. Map-based registers (should be arrays)
5. No dereferencing optimization

READY FOR PHASE 1: YES ✅
- Baseline captured
- Pattern confirmed
- No blocking issues
