Common guard utility predicates (built-ins documented).

Built-in guards:
- ground(X): succeeds when X contains no unbound variables
- known(X): succeeds if X is bound
- unknown(X): succeeds if X is unbound
- reader(X): succeeds if X is a reader (X?)
- writer(X): succeeds if X is a writer (X)
- otherwise: succeeds if no other clause matches

Cases: synchronization guards, mode detection
