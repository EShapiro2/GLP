=== inject.glp ===
Deferred message injection.
Goal: inject(Trigger, Msg, InStream, OutStream)

Defers insertion until trigger variable becomes bound.
Allows stream to continue flowing while waiting.
When Trigger known, inserts Msg at output.
Until then, passes messages through.

Cases: known/unknown guards, non-blocking protocols
