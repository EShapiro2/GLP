=== channel_ops.glp ===
Channel operation primitives.
Goal: send(X, Ch, Ch1) or receive(X, Ch, Ch1) or new_channel(Ch1, Ch2)

Operations (defined as guard predicates via unit clauses):
- send(X, Ch, Ch1): adds message X to output stream
- receive(X, Ch, Ch1): removes message X from input stream
- new_channel(Ch1, Ch2): creates paired channels

A channel is ch(In?,Out) where In? is input reader, Out is output writer.
