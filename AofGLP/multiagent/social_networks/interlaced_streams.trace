=== interlaced_streams.glp ===
Interlaced streams as distributed blocklace.

Blocklace: DAG where each block references multiple predecessors.
Enables concurrent block creation without consensus.

Each process maintains stream of blocks with payloads and references
to most recent blocks observed from others. unknown(X?) guard identifies
unprocessed blocks by detecting unbound tail variables.

--- Test: Single agent (no other streams) ---
Query: streams(S, []).

S = stream([block(r1, []), block(r2, [])])
→ succeeds

--- Test: Interlacing with incomplete streams ---
%% Trace: streams(Result, [[block(p1, [])|Ptail], [block(q1, [])|Qtail]])
%%
%% Tests interlacing with incomplete streams from two other agents.
%% P has produced block(p1, []) with unbound tail Ptail
%% Q has produced block(q1, []) with unbound tail Qtail
%%
%% Result: First block r1 collects tips from both P and Q.
%% Second block r2 suspends waiting for more blocks from P and Q.

Result = stream([block(r1, [block(p1, []), block(q1, [])]), block(r2, X)])
Ptail = <unbound>
Qtail = <unbound>
→ suspended
