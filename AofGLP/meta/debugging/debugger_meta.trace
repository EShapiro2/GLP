=== debugger_meta.glp ===
Parallel debugger metainterpreter.
Goal: reduce(Program, Goal, N, Tree)

N = number of reductions before waiting.
Tree = execution tree being built.

When N reaches 0, waits for Mode:
- debug(M, T) continues with M reductions
- raw executes Goal directly without interpretation

Cases: step debugging, execution trees, mode switching
