\section{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\star$] Implement \verb|length(Xs?, N)| that computes the length of a list using an accumulator.

\item[$\star$] Implement \verb|map_inc(Xs?, Ys)| that increments each element of a list of numbers. For example, \verb|map_inc([1,2,3], Ys)| yields \verb|Ys = [2,3,4]|.

\item[$\star\star$] Implement \verb|filter_even(Xs?, Ys)| that keeps only even numbers from a list. For example, \verb|filter_even([1,2,3,4,5,6], Ys)| yields \verb|Ys = [2,4,6]|. Use guards to test each element.

\item[$\star\star$] The predicates in this chapter process lists element-by-element using tail recursion with an accumulator. Explain why these are \emph{iterative} rather than \emph{recursive}. What would you see in a trace---concurrent processes or a single process stepping through the list?

\item[$\star\star\star$] Generalize \verb|map_inc| to \verb|map(Xs?, F, Ys)| that applies an arbitrary transformation \verb|F| to each element. What language features would you need? (This is explored in Chapter~\ref{ch:metainterpreters}.)
\end{enumerate}
