=== stream_security.glp ===
Blockchain security properties of GLP streams.

Properties:
1. IMMUTABILITY: single-assignment prevents rebinding
2. UNFORKABILITY: SRSW ensures one writer per variable
3. NON-REPUDIATION: attestations provide cryptographic proof
4. ACYCLICITY: occurs check prevents circular bindings

Example: Cooperative stream extension with explicit handover.
Cases: SRSW enforcement, attestation, occurs check
