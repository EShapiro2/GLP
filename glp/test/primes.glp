% primes.glp - Sieve of Eratosthenes
%
% From Concurrent Prolog course (handout 4)
% Uses mod operator and =:=/=\= guards for filtering multiples

% ===== DIRECT EXECUTION =====

% primes(N, Ps) :- Ps is the list of primes up to N
primes(N, Ps?) :-
  integers(2, N?, Is),
  sieve(Is?, Ps).

% integers(From, To, Xs) :- Xs is [From, From+1, ..., To]
integers(From, To, [From?]) :-
  From? =:= To? | true.
integers(From, To, [From?|Xs?]) :-
  From? < To? |
  From1 := From? + 1,
  integers(From1?, To?, Xs).

% sieve(Xs, Ys) :- filter out multiples
sieve([], []).
sieve([P|Xs], [P?|Ys?]) :-
  ground(P?) |
  filter(P?, Xs?, Zs),
  sieve(Zs?, Ys).

% filter(P, Xs, Ys) :- Ys is Xs with multiples of P removed
filter(_, [], []).
filter(P, [X|Xs], Ys?) :-
  ground(P?), ground(X?), X? mod P? =:= 0 |
  filter(P?, Xs?, Ys).
filter(P, [X|Xs], [X?|Ys?]) :-
  ground(P?), ground(X?), X? mod P? =\= 0 |
  filter(P?, Xs?, Ys).

% ===== METAINTERPRETER =====

run_primes(true).
run_primes((A, B)) :- run_primes(A?), run_primes(B?).
run_primes(A) :- otherwise | reduce_primes(A?, B), run_primes(B?).

% ===== REDUCE CLAUSES =====

% primes/2
reduce_primes(primes(N, Ps?),
       (integers(2, N?, Is),
        sieve(Is?, Ps))).

% integers/3
reduce_primes(integers(From, To, [From?]), true) :-
  From? =:= To? | true.
reduce_primes(integers(From, To, [From?|Xs?]),
       (From1 := From? + 1,
        integers(From1?, To?, Xs))) :-
  From? < To? | true.

% sieve/2
reduce_primes(sieve([], []), true).
reduce_primes(sieve([P|Xs], [P?|Ys?]),
       (filter(P?, Xs?, Zs),
        sieve(Zs?, Ys))) :-
  ground(P?) | true.

% filter/3
reduce_primes(filter(_, [], []), true).
reduce_primes(filter(P, [X|Xs], Ys?),
       filter(P?, Xs?, Ys)) :-
  ground(P?), ground(X?), X? mod P? =:= 0 | true.
reduce_primes(filter(P, [X|Xs], [X?|Ys?]),
       filter(P?, Xs?, Ys)) :-
  ground(P?), ground(X?), X? mod P? =\= 0 | true.

% Note: := is handled directly by the runtime, no reduce clause needed

% ===== TESTS =====
% Direct: primes(20, Ps) should give Ps = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
% Meta:   run_primes(primes(20, Ps)) should give same result
