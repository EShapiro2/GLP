% GLP System Predicate: = (Unification)
%
% Binds the first argument (writer) to the second argument's value.
%
% Usage:
%   X = foo     - Binds X to foo
%   X = foo(a)  - Binds X to foo(a)
%   X = Y?      - Binds X to Y's value
%
% Definition: X? = X means the same variable appears as reader (second arg)
% then writer (first arg), enabling unification in GLP's SRSW model.

X? = X.
