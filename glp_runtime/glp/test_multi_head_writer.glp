% Test multiple head writers with ground guard
% lookup(Key, [(Key, Value)|_], Value?) - Key appears twice in head

% With ground guard - should compile
lookup(Key, [(Key, Value)|_], Value?) :- ground(Key?) | true.
lookup(Key, [_|Rest], Value?) :- otherwise | lookup(Key?, Rest?, Value).

% Test query: lookup(b, [(a,1),(b,2)], V).
% Expected: V = 2
