% Deep tests with variables at various depths

% Level 1-4 with var
t1(X?, Y?) :- X = foo(Y).
t2(X?, Y?) :- X = a(b(Y)).
t3(X?, Y?) :- X = a(b(c(Y))).
t4(X?, Y?) :- X = a(b(c(d(Y)))).

% Level 6 with var at bottom
t6(X?, Y?) :- X = a(b(c(d(e(f(Y)))))).

% Level 8 with var
t8(X?, Y?) :- X = a(b(c(d(e(f(g(h(Y)))))))).

% Level 10 with var
t10(X?, Y?) :- X = a(b(c(d(e(f(g(h(i(j(Y)))))))))).

% Mixed: struct with siblings + var at depth
mix(X?, Y?) :- X = pair(left(a(Y)), right(b(z))).

% Siblings in list with var at depth
siblings(X?, Y?) :- X = wrapper([foo(Y), bar(z)]).

% Deep list nesting with var
deep_list(X?, Y?) :- X = [[foo(Y)]].

% Stress: 3 levels, var in first branch only
stress(X?, Y?) :- X = t(
    a([a1(Y), a2(x)]),
    b([b1(x), b2(x)])
).
