# GLP Known Issues

**Last updated:** 2026-05-18

## Issue 0a: Parser does not support `=..` as a goal in clause bodies

**Status:** Open

```glp
%% This FAILS:
compose(List, Tuple) :- Tuple? =.. List?.
%% Error: "Expected predicate name or comparison" at =..

%% This WORKS (in clause head):
X? =.. [Y|Ys] :- list(Ys?) | list_to_tuple([Y|Ys], X).
```

Parser needs to recognise `=..` as a valid goal in bodies.

## Issue 0b: REPL cannot parse compound terms inside lists in goal arguments

**Status:** Open
**Location:** `glp_runtime/bin/glp_repl.dart` — functions `_buildListTermForConj` and `_buildListTerm` handle `ConstTerm`, `VarTerm`, `ListTerm` but not `StructTerm`.

```glp
%% This FAILS in REPL goal:
distribute_indexed([send(1,a), send(2,b)], Y, Z).
%% Error: Exception: Unsupported list head type: StructTerm

%% This WORKS:
distribute_indexed([], Y, Z).
```

What works: simple lists `[a,b,c]`, nested lists `[[a,b], [1,2]]`, variables `[X?, Y?]`. What fails: structs in lists `[send(1,a), foo(x)]`.

Impact: can't test predicates that take lists of structures from REPL goals.  Workaround: test from within a program clause.

## Issue 1: Localize uses writer address where reader address is needed

**Status**: Open
**Discovered**: 2026-02-10
**Affects**: Multi-agent (madGLP) programs where a term with unbound variables is sent between agents

### Summary

The `localize()` function in `mad_helpers.dart` substitutes the writer address into the term where the spec requires the reader address. This causes `ground()` guards on the receiving agent to fail definitively instead of suspending.

### Root Cause

`localize()` takes a `freshAddrAllocator: int Function()` callback that returns only the writer address. The caller discards the reader address:

```dart
freshAddrAllocator: () {
  final (w, _) = runtime.heap.allocateVariable();  // allocates pair (writerN, readerN+1)
  return w;                                          // discards reader address
},
```

Inside `localize()`:

```dart
final writerAddr = freshAddrAllocator();
final readerAddr = writerAddr;  // WRONG: should be the actual reader address
```

When localizing `_w(p, i)` (incoming writer from remote agent), the spec says to replace it with `Y_q?` (the reader). But because `readerAddr == writerAddr`, the code substitutes `VarRef(writerAddr)` — a writer, not a reader.

### Consequence

On the receiving agent, the term contains a VarRef pointing to a writer cell. When `ground()` traverses the term and finds this unbound writer, it takes the "unbound writer → definitive failure" path (correct for single-agent SRSW, wrong here). The goal fails instead of suspending on the reader and waking when the remote assignment arrives.

### Observable Effect

In `three_agent_pipeline_boot.glp`, agent3's `consumer_init` receives a partially-bound list like `[got(1), got(2) | X2]` where X2 is a localized variable. Because X2 is a writer (should be reader), `ground(Ys?)` fails and the goal terminates instead of suspending until the rest of the list arrives. The test passes as a **false positive** because a failed goal reports agent completion (zero remaining goals).

### Fix Status

**Fixed**: Changed `freshAddrAllocator` signature from `int Function()` to `(int, int) Function()`, returning both `(writerAddr, readerAddr)`. Updated `localize()` and all 4 callers in `mad_context.dart`.

Note: this fix alone does NOT resolve the pipeline test failure — the root cause is in globalise/send (see Issue 2 and `docs/bug-send-globalise-localise.md`).

### Broader Concern: N+1 Arithmetic

The heap-pointer architecture spec states that writer and reader cells point to each other via cross-pointers, so address arithmetic (`writerAddr + 1`) should never be needed. However, `pairedReaderAddr()` in `heap_fcp.dart` has a fallback `return writerAddr + 1`. An audit should verify that no code depends on the N/N+1 allocation convention — all navigation between paired cells should use the cross-pointers.

### Files Involved

- `glp_runtime/lib/multiagent/mad_helpers.dart` — `localize()` function (lines 212-255)
- `glp_runtime/lib/multiagent/mad_context.dart` — all `freshAddrAllocator` callbacks
- `glp_runtime/lib/runtime/heap_fcp.dart` — `allocateVariable()`, `pairedReaderAddr()` fallback
- `programs/typed_book/multiagent_tests/three_agent_pipeline_boot.glp` — test that exercises the bug

### Test

After fixing all issues, `three_agent_pipeline_boot.glp` should show agent3's `consumer_init` suspending on `ground(Ys?)`, then waking when the full list `[got(1), got(2), got(3)]` arrives, then completing via `wrap` and `consume`.

## Issue 2: TermVar.pairedReaderAddr returns wrong address

**Status**: Fixed
**Discovered**: 2026-02-10
**Affects**: All multi-agent programs that send terms containing writers
**See also**: `docs/bug-send-globalise-localise.md`

### Summary

`TermVar.pairedReaderAddr` returned `addr` (the writer address itself) instead of the actual paired reader address from the heap. `TermVar` only stored a single address, with no way to look up the paired address.

### Fix

Redesigned `TermVar` to carry both `writerAddr` and `readerAddr` fields, populated by `_extractTermVarsRecursive()` using the heap's cross-pointer methods (`tryWriterForReader`, `pairedReaderAddr`). All call sites updated.

## Issue 3: Spurious write-back mechanism for localized _w variables

**Status**: Removed
**Discovered**: 2026-02-10
**Affects**: N/A (the mechanism was incorrect and has been removed)

### Summary

A write-back mechanism (`_registerWriteBackCallbacks`, `_sendWriteBack`) was added to handle the case where agent q localizes `_w(p, i)`, creates a fresh pair `(Y_q, Y_q?)`, and then binds Y_q locally. The write-back sent `_w(p, i) := T` back to agent p.

### Why It Was Wrong

This mechanism does not exist in GLP. The data flow for `_w(p, i)` is strictly p→q: p assigns the writer, the `global_send` goal at p fires, and the value is delivered to q's entry. There is no reverse flow. If a program needs q→p flow (the receiver writes back), the sender must export the reader, producing `_r(p, i)`, and the `global_send` spawned at q by `localize` handles the outgoing direction.

### Resolution

Removed `_registerWriteBackCallbacks()`, `_sendWriteBack()`, and all call sites from `mad_context.dart`. Test programs that relied on this mechanism need to use the correct polarity (export reader for q→p flow).

## Issue 4: Type checker rejects well-typed `=` with reader argument

**Status**: Open
**Discovered**: 2026-02-10
**Affects**: Any typed program using `=` (unification) with a reader variable

### Summary

The type checker rejects the following well-typed clause:

```prolog
procedure bind_later(_).
bind_later(Done?) :- wait(1000) | done(Done).
```

Error: "Variable mode mismatch: writer requires ↑ (produce), got ↓ (consume)" for `Done` at the `=` call site (or equivalent body atom).

### Analysis

The prelude declares `=` as:

```prolog
procedure =(_?, _).
X = X?.
```

Position 0 is `_?` (reader), position 1 is `_` (writer). In the clause `bind_later(Done?)`, `Done` is the reader of the writer passed by the caller. Using `Done` as the first argument of `=` (the `_?` position) should be well-typed since `Done` is already a reader. The type checker incorrectly rejects this.

### Workaround

Use `done(Done)` instead of `Done = done` to avoid `=` entirely.

## Issue 5: localize() spawn uses reader address; onBind needs writer address

**Status**: Fixed
**Discovered**: 2026-02-10
**Affects**: Multi-agent programs where a localized `_r(p, i)` should trigger a `global_send` back to agent p

### Summary

In `localize()`, processing `_r(p, i)` creates a `GlobalSendSpawn` with `readerAddr: readerAddr`. But `registerGlobalSendSpawns()` passes `spawn.readerAddr` to `heap.onBind()`, which is indexed by **writer** address. The callback never fires because the reader address is not a valid key for `onBind`.

### Fix

Changed `localize()` to pass `writerAddr` in the spawn's `readerAddr` field. The field name is misleading (it is actually the `onBind` key), but the semantics are now correct.

---

## Issue 6: globalize-reader entry stores reader address instead of writer address

**Status**: Fixed (part 1); part 2 removed
**Discovered**: 2026-02-10
**Affects**: Multi-agent programs where agent p globalizes a reader `X?` as `_r(p, i)`

### Summary

`globalize()` passed `v.addr` (the reader address) to `addGlobalizeEntry()`, which stores it as `writerAddr`. But `_handleReaderAssignment` later calls `bindVariable(entry.writerAddr, ...)` — passing a reader address to `bindVariable` is incorrect.

### Fix

Changed `globalize()` to pass `v.writerAddr` (the actual writer) to `addGlobalizeEntry()`.

### Note on onBind

A previous fix also added an onBind callback in `send()` for globalize-reader entries, using `_sendWriteBack`. This was incorrect — for `_r(p, i)`, agent p creates an entry and WAITS. The `global_send` is spawned at q by `localize`, not at p. Agent p does not send anything for `_r` entries. The onBind and write-back have been removed.
