Mandatory protocol for debugging the GLP implementation with GLP programsThe protocol applies when a GLP program x.glp is behaving incorrectly on a goal G0.It assumes that the GLP program is correct and well understood, the implementation is generally working (on other programs and other goals on this program. And the expected behavior of the program on the goal is well understood.Mandatory steps:Don’t move from one step to the next if a step not successful.  Stop, report, and consult user.1. Identify a faulty goal/clause reduction:- Run G0 on x, tracing goal/clause reductions, and if needed also variable bindings.- Find the first faulty goal/clause reduction, with goal G and clause H :- B, in which G is a valid goal (not corrupted or violating SRSW), and the reduction is incorrect:  incorrect success, failure, suspension, binding, or creation of body goals.2.  Create a program cx.glp with the clause H:-B, and run G on it.- If the bug is not demonstrated investigate: add a clause test :- G and run test. If there are discrepancies identify them: errors in display, difference in clause compilation and repl goal compilation, some state variable that is different etc. If you fail report to the user.- Check the byte code of cx to see that it is correct.- Trace the run of G on cx with increasing precision (printing more/single-stepping) , until you identify the bug.  If you do, correct it and start again with G0 and x.glp- If you have difficulties identifying the bug, create a minimal clause H’ :- B’ and with goal G’ that manifest the bug, and repeat step 2 with this simpler goal and clause.If you failed, stop and report.
