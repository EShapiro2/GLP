% FUTURE TEST: Requires := arithmetic operator
% From Concurrent Prolog course (handout 5 - Hamming)

% multiply(N, Xs, Ys) :- Ys is Xs with each element multiplied by N
multiply(_, [], []).
multiply(N, [X|Xs], [Y?|Ys?]) :-
  Y := N? * X?,
  multiply(N?, Xs?, Ys).

% Test: multiply(3, [1,2,3,4], Ys) should give Ys = [3,6,9,12]
